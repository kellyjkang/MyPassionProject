		<p class="pink"> <span class="pinktext"> I am so excited to finally learn how to code! </span> It has seemed like an unapproachable and inaccessible subject for a long time. This is a great opportunity and I hope to put it to good use in the near future.

		<p class="justify"> I was born in Los Angeles and lived there until I was 12. <span class="pinktext"> I then moved to Seoul, South Korea and attended international school there. For college I decided to come to New York City and attend the greatest school ever, Barnard College. </span> I'm really interested in alleviating inequalities at the community level. Hopefully coding will be a great start to gaining some direction in how to do that!</p>
