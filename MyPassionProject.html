	<div style="color:pink"> <p> I am so excited to finally learn how to code! It has seemed like an unapproachable and inaccessible subject for a long time. This is a great opportunity and I hope to put it to good use in the near future.</p> </div>

	<p> I was born in Los Angeles and lived there until I was 12. I then moved to Seoul, South Korea and attended international school there. For college I decided to come to New York City and attend the greatest school ever, Barnard College. I'm really interested in alleviating inequalities at the community level. Hopefully coding will be a great start to gaining some direction in how to do that!</p>
